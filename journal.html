            <h1>My visit to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston</h1>
            <p>During winter break, I had the pleasure of revisiting the Egyptology exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston with my boyfriend. Here are some images I have captured.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="funeral mask">
            <h2>Funeral Mask of a royal</h2>
            <img src="IMG_5944.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="Funeral mask of a royal, front view" />
            <img src="IMG_5945.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="Funeral mask of a royal, side view" />
            <p>This is a beautifully crafted funeral mask of a royal woman, likely a queen or a princess. It is a rare artifact found in a sarcophagus, and is incredibaly well-preserved as you can still see the saturated colors and drawings on its surface.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sculpture1">
            <h2>Sculpture of a godess</h2>
            <img src="IMG_5947.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="Sculpture of a godess that is cut off at the midsection of her face" />
            <p>This is a part of a sculpture of a goddess. It is likely broken somewhere during the thousands of year after its making. However, this small piece of a larger sculpture still reveals the intricacies and details of the overall sculpture, and is exampliary of the exceptional beauty of assymmetry.</p>
        </div>	
        <div class="sculpture2">
            <h2>Sculpture of a royal</h2>
            <img src="IMG_5948.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="A golden sculpture of a godess" />
            <p>This is a gold-encrusted sculpture of a goddess. The textures in this sculpture is astonishing. While the face and body of the woman is covered in gold, her hair dress is marble, also carefully sculpted. The makeup around her eyes only accentuate her gaze even more.</p>
        </div>	
        <div class="sculpture3">
            <h2>Sarcophagus covering of a royal</h2>
            <img src="IMG_5939.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="A marble sculpture of a man cut off at the neck" />
            <p>This is a marble carving at the outter-most layer of a sarcophogus. The marble is a very light beige and embodies great symmetry. The royal man depicted in this carving is smiling, as if glad to enter the paradise of afterlife.</p>
        </div>	
        <div class="organ jar">
            <h2>Jars containing a mummy's organs</h2>
            <img src="IMG_5942.jpeg" width = "1000" alt="Four aqua-colored jars filled with organs during the mummification process" />
            <p>These are four jars containing the organs of the mummified individual. Each having a different god as the opening of the jar, these gods protect the different organs of the body.</p>
