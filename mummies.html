    <p>Ancient Egyptians believed in an afterlife when someone died.  Mummification helped someone reach the afterlife as they believed that an afterlife could only exist if there was a form the ka (soul) could repossess after death. Egyptians believed that the only way to do this was if the body was recognisable. This is why they spent so long on the process of mummification and why Pharaohs began the building of their tombs during their lifetimes.</p>
    <p>This is the step-by-step process of how mummification took place:  </p>

    <p>11. After the 70 days wrap the body from head to toe in bandages</p>
    <p>12. Place in a sarcophagus (a type of box like a coffin)</p>
    <p>13. If the person had been a Pharaoh, he would be placed inside a special burial chamber with lots of treasure.</p>
